# Overview

Welcome!

BitcoinBook.dev started as a list of hyperlinks, notes, and text I found to be useful while learning about Bitcoin.

This project is open-source and contributions are highly encouraged.

If you find any mistakes, [open an Issue on Github](https://github.com/philipglazman/bitcoinnotes/issues/new).

## Introduction <a id="c69099a2-1292-4a37-b4da-aae0fe1331f1"></a>

I am hoping these notes serve a useful purpose to the reader in getting started with Bitcoin or refreshing old knowledge. The best way to use this document is to search for topics by heading and sub-heading and follow hyperlinks to the original resources.

The audience of this document is expected to have a technical background, but this soft requirement should not let the reader become reluctant in learning about Bitcoin at a deep level.

The ideal state of this document is to become an authoritative resource and practical guide for software engineers that want to build applications with Bitcoin. Any suggestions to reach that state are highly appreciated. To follow the progress of this document, please refer to the git [respository](https://github.com/philipglazman/bitcoinnotes).
