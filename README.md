# Bitcoin Book
#### [bitcoinbook.dev](https://bitcoinbook.dev)

The [bitcoinbook.dev](https://bitcoinbook.dev) is a curated list of resources tailored to software engineers learning about Bitcoin. It aims to provide important contextual information when discussing technical concepts.

When I first started learning about Bitcoin, I kept notes of engineering concepts, tutorials, or historical BitcoinTalk posts. The notes became the foundation of this project. I still update my notes, but these notes have are now publicly accessible through [bitcoinbook.dev](https://bitcoinbook.dev).

Inspiration for this project comes from the [Linux Documentation Project](https://tldp.org/) and [Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/en/publications/).

If we want Bitcoin to be accessible,  we have to document the technical knowledge  and the lessons learned along the way!

## State of the Project
There is a tree of topics outlined in the Table of Contents. Sequentially adding content to each "Chapter" is the current priority. Afterwards, styling and graphics can be added to aid the reader in explanation of certain key concepts.

## Contributing
The content file is `bitcoin.org`. The best experience is to edit the file using GNU Emacs' [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/).

With Org Mode, it is very straightforward to [export to HTML](https://orgmode.org/manual/HTML-Export.html) or your [favorite file format](https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#Exporting)!.

PRs and Issues are very welcome!
